# Как мне создать имя файла с недопустимыми символами, такими как:?>?

**_Some operating systems prohibit some particular characters from appearing in file names:_**(Resource from[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename))

**/ slash** used as a path name component separator in Unix-like, Windows, and Amiga systems. (The MS-DOS command.com shell would consume it as a switch character, but Windows itself always accepts it as a separator\[2\]\[vague\])

**\\ backslash** Also used as a path name component separator in MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows (there is no difference between slash and backslash); allowed in Unix filename

**? question mark** used as a wildcard in Unix, Windows and AmigaOS; marks a single character. Allowed in Unix filenames

**\* asterisk** used as a wildcard in Unix, MS-DOS, RT-11, VMS and Windows. Marks any sequence of characters (Unix, Windows, later versions of MS-DOS) or any sequence of characters in either the basename or extension (thus "_._" in early versions of MS-DOS means "all files". Allowed in Unix filenames,

**: colon** used to determine the mount point / drive on Windows; used to determine the virtual device or physical device such as a drive on AmigaOS, RT-11 and VMS; used as a pathname separator in classic Mac OS. Doubled after a name on VMS, indicates the DECnet nodename (equivalent to a NetBIOS (Windows networking) hostname preceded by "\\".)

**| vertical bar** designates software pipelining in Unix and Windows; allowed in Unix filenames

**" quotation mark** used to mark beginning and end of filenames containing spaces in Windows

**< less than** used to redirect input, allowed in Unix filenames

**\> greater than** used to redirect output, allowed in Unix filenames

**. period** allowed but the last occurrence will be interpreted to be the extension separator in VMS, MS-DOS and Windows. In other OSes, usually considered as part of the filename, and more than one full stop may be allowed.
